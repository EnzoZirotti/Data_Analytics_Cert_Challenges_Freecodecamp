# Data_Analytics_Cert_Challenges_Freecodecamp

# This is something I wanted to try just to see if I could do it for fun. Each of these challenges were assigned by Freecodecamp.org.

## 1. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator 
### The First Challenge was to create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.


## 2.Demographic Data Analyzer
### The second challenge was to analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.  
### You must use Pandas to answer the following questions:

### How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
